# Tubip Fabrication Simulator

A small game about fabricating tubip.

## How to play
- Hit the FABRICATE button to fabricate tubip.
- Tubip matter is needed for fabrication. You'll get every so often - watch the counters!
- You can sell tubip for coins on the Market.
- Coins can be used to buy upgrades that might help you fabricate more tubip.
- Keep an eye on the news ticker! Efficiency and exchange rates fluctuate based on recent events (and also randomly).

## Running TFS yourself

Tubip Fabrication Simulator is written using Svelte and Vite, with no extra backend. To run it, do:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or try:

```bash
npm run build
```

...to get a built version at `/dist` - you can deploy it anywhere!

This repo also contains a [workflow for GitHub Pages](./.github/workflows/publish.yaml), if that helps.
